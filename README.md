# EnumHolidayRegistryJava
This project aims to create a holiday registration system using Java. The system utilizes the concept of enumeration (enum) to differentiate holiday types (municipal, state, national) and encapsulation to manage each holiday's information. The project includes a test interface where real holidays are instantiated with their respective dates.
